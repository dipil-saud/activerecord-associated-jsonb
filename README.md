# ActiveRecordAssociatedJsonb

[![Codeship Status for dipil-saud/activerecord-associated-jsonb](https://app.codeship.com/projects/20aaa450-bcca-0136-b9cd-4a53bd4c8e4c/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/312783)

The activerecord-jsonb-gem augments ActiveRecord's attribute API to allow accessing and updating data stored in jsonb columns as AR models.
It allows using validations on the embedded record and tracks changes.

Currently only supports postgres jsonb columns.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'activerecord-associated-jsonb', github: 'dipil-saud/activerecord-associated-jsonb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Example Usage

```ruby
  require 'active_record_associated_jsonb'

  class Address < ActiveRecordAssociatedJsonb::Record
    attribute :line1
    attribute :line2
    attribute :city
    attribute :zip_code, type: :integer
    attribute :country, default: 'US'

    ##### VALIDATIONS #####
    validates :line1,
      :city,
      :zip_code,
      :country,
      presence: true
    validates :zip_code, :format => /\A\d{5}(-\d{4})?\z/
  end

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    attribute :addresses, ActiveRecordAssociatedJsonb::Type.new(child_class: Address)
  end

  # create a user with addresses
  u = User.new(addresses: { line1: '...', zip_code: '...' ..}])

  # or
  u = User.new
  a = Address.new({ line1: ... })
  u.addresses << a

  a.valid?
  a.errors # shows details for each address attribute

  u.valid?
  u.errors # only shows addresses is invalid like it would for has_many relation
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
